      <h2>Domicile Exceptions</h2>
<p>A student's residence status is determined by <a href="https://www.schev.edu/financial-aid/in-state-residency/guidelines-for-in-state-residency-tuition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Section 23-7.4 of the Code of Virginia</a>.</p>
      <p>Certain students who are in the United States on a non-immigrant visa are eligible to establish domicile in the state of Virginia, and are, therefore, eligible for the in-state tuition rate. The student must provide necessary immigration and state financial documentation to the Office of the Registrar. To appeal an Out-of-State status you must file an <a href="/renderfile/94b561f30a0000fe4ebac7570bb934e0/policy/forms/11-0010.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Application for Re-classification of Student's Domicile Status</a> with the Office of the Registrar.</p>
      <h2>Tuition Payment Due Dates</h2>
      <p>Your payment/charge for the tuition and fees for all classes must be made and settled in full according to the payment schedule. Students failing to pay in full by these deadlines risk enrollment cancellation. Students may lose some or all of their desired courses if their tuition and fees are not paid in full.</p>

      <h2>Domicile Exceptions</h2>
      <p>A student's residence status is determined by <a href="https://www.schev.edu/financial-aid/in-state-residency/guidelines-for-in-state-residency-tuition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Section 23-7.4 of the Code of Virginia</a>.</p>
      <p>Certain students who are in the United States on a non-immigrant visa are eligible to establish domicile in the state of Virginia, and are, therefore, eligible for the in-state tuition rate. The student must provide necessary immigration and state financial documentation to the Office of the Registrar. To appeal an Out-of-State status you must file an <a href="/renderfile/94b561f30a0000fe4ebac7570bb934e0/policy/forms/11-0010.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Application for Re-classification of Student's Domicile Status</a> with the Office of the Registrar.</p>
      <h2>Tuition Payment Due Dates</h2>
      <p>Your payment/charge for the tuition and fees for all classes must be made and settled in full according to the payment schedule. Students failing to pay in full by these deadlines risk enrollment cancellation. Students may lose some or all of their desired courses if their tuition and fees are not paid in full.</p>
